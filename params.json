The prototype version is free to use and is made available for you to be able to evaluate the IGE before you decide to purchase a license.\r\n\r\nFor now it only contains the various examples that are included with the full version of the IGE and each example includes a \"deploy\" folder where you can run a compiled version of the example. \"Compiled\" is not meant in the strict computer programming sense since you cannot compile JavaScript but in the more general sense in that the full IGE includes a handy script that scans your project, determines all the dependencies and then packages up all your game code and engine code that you used into one single game.js file.\r\n\r\nThe deployment packager also removes any server-side code from the source automatically so when writing multiplayer / networked games none of your server-side code is visible to the client even if they do a view-source on the game.js file.\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments, questions, requests, issues or bug reports please use the GitHub issue tracker for this repository: https://github.com/coolbloke1324/ige_prototype/issues"}
